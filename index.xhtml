				Random thoughts on Star Trek

			<h3>
				1. Noisy doors.
			</h3>
		 	<p> 
				You can't walk three feet in a starship without some door whooshing or screeching at you. 
				My office building has automatic sliding doors. They're dead silent. If those doors went "wheet!" 
				every time a person walked through them, about once a month some guy in accounting would snap and 
				go on a shooting rampage. 
			</p>
			<p>	
				Sorry Scotty, the IEEE has revoked your membership until you learn to master WD-40
			</p>
		</div>

			<h3> 
				2. The Federation.
			</h3>	
			<img src="federation_badge.jpg" alt="Federation Badge" title="Federation badge" />
			<p>
				This organization creeps me out. A planet-wide government that runs everything, and that has abolished money. 
				A veritable planetary DMV. Oh sure, it looks like a cool place when you're rocketing around in a 
				Federation Starship, but I wonder how the guy driving a Federation dump truck feels about it?
			</p>
			<p>
				And everyone has to wear those spandex uniforms. Here's an important fact: 
				Most people, you don't want to see them in spandex. You'd pay good money to not have to see them. 
				If money hadn't been abolished, that is. So you're screwed.
			</p>
		</div>

			<h3>
				3. Reversing the Polarity.
			</h3>
			<p>
				For cripes sake Giordi, stop reversing the polarity of everything! It might work once in a while, 
				but usually it just screws things up. I have it on good authority that the technicians at Starbase 12 HATE that. 
				Every time the Enterprise comes in for its 10,000 hour checkup, they've gotta go through the 
				whole damned ship fixing stuff. "What happened to the toilet in Stateroom 3?" "Well, the plumbing backed up, 
				and Giordi thought he could fix it by reversing the polarity."
			</p>
			<p>
				Between Scotty's poor lubrication habits and Geordi's damned polarity reversing trick, 
				it's a wonder the Enterprise doesn't just spontaneously explode whenever they put the juice to it.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>
				4. Seatbelts.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Yeah, I know this one is overdone, but you'd think that the first time an explosion caused the guy at 
				the nav station to fly over the captain's head with a good 8 feet of clearance, someone would say, 
				"You know, we might think of inventing some furutistic restraining device to prevent that from happening." 
				So of course, they did make something like that for the second Enterprise (the first one blew up due to 
				poor lubrication), but what was it? A hard plastic thing that's locked over your thighs. Oh, I'll bet 
				THAT feels good in the corners. "Hey look! The leg-bars worked as advertised! There goes Kirk's torso!"
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h3>
				5. No fuses.
			</h3>
			<p>
				Every time there's a power surge on the Enterprise the various stations and consoles explode in a 
				shower of sparks and throw their seatbelt-less operators over Picard's head. If we could get Giordi 
				to stop reversing the polarity for a minute, we could get him to go shopping at the nearest Starship 
				parts store and pick up a few fuses. And while he's shopping, he could stop at an intergalactic IKEA 
				and pick up a few chairs for the bridge personnel. If you're going to put me in front of a fuseless 
				exploding console all day, the least you could do is let me sit down.
